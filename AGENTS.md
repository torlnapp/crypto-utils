# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` holds the TypeScript source. Key areas are `src/algorithms/`, `src/utils/`, `src/models/`, `src/types/`, and the public entry at `src/index.ts`.
- `tests/` contains Bun tests (currently `tests/crypto-utils.test.ts`).
- `dist/` is the build output generated by `tsdown` and is the published package content.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `bun install` installs dependencies.
- `bun run lint` runs Biome formatting + linting with auto-fix.
- `bun run check` runs TypeScript type-checking (`tsc --noEmit`).
- `bun test` runs the Bun test suite.
- `bun run build` runs lint, tests, and bundles to `dist/` via `tsdown`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript, ESM modules, and strict type-checking are required (see `tsconfig.json`).
- Formatting/linting is enforced by Biome (`biome.json`). Use single quotes and spaces for indentation.
- Prefer descriptive, crypto-domain naming (e.g., `generateNonce`, `processCiphertext`).
- Export public APIs from `src/index.ts`; keep internal helpers in `src/utils/`.

## Testing Guidelines
- Tests use `bun:test` with `describe/test/expect`.
- Name tests with clear behavior statements (e.g., “AES encrypt/decrypt round-trip”).
- Run full coverage before release: `bun test`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits (examples: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `refactor: ...`, `test: ...`, `chore: ...`).
- PRs should include a short summary, testing performed, and any relevant issue links.
- If behavior changes or new APIs are added, update tests and document in the PR description.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- This package expects Web Crypto APIs to be available in the runtime.
- Avoid committing secrets or private keys; use test fixtures only.
